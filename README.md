# Weather

This project shows the temperature (current, max and min), pressure and humidity based on the current geolocation of the browser.

That project was coded as part of the Programador Fullstack Javascript course by OneBitCode https://programador.onebitcode.com/

It uses React and axios and the https://openweathermap.org/ weather API. The aplication get's the browser latitude and longitude and uses it to get the weather info from the server.

You need to create a .env file in the root folder and add a API key from openweathermap to run the project and install reasct and axios.

The .env file content:

REACT_APP_OPEN_WHEATHER_KEY=\<your open weather credential\>
